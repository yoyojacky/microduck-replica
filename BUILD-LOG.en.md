# Build Log

[简体中文](构建日志.md) · **English**

> **Current status: Feetech HD-1910 robot assembled (2026-09-13)**
> Status index updated: 2026-09-28; historical print photos below.

This repository combines geometry and electronics analysis recovered from the public MJCF and source with physical testing.
This log records **actually building it**: what was printed, what was assembled, and what
went wrong.

Latest electrical work: HAT received; camera capture passed on official B1 after correcting the ribbon connection. Retesting the project image is next. The mouth servo has temporarily replaced failed ID 21. See the [debug log](调试记录.md) and [camera wiring record](tools/radxa/摄像头调试记录-20260928.md) (Chinese).

> ⚠️ This repository states repeatedly that **simulation STLs are not manufacturing files**
> — simulation only guarantees outer shape and inertia, not fit tolerances, threads,
> heat-set insert bosses or cable clearance.
> **This log is the test of that claim.** The result will be recorded honestly, either way.

## Progress

| Date | Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-01 | First parts printed | 🔨 in progress | head shell, trunk shell, leg structure, feet |
| 2026-09-02 | Leg parts trial-fitted | 🔨 in progress | **M2 screws installed — the hole pattern works** |

## Problems Hit

> This is the most valuable section of the log — **so others do not have to hit them.**
> Each entry is written as symptom → cause → fix. Unsolved ones say so.

## Dimensional Verification

Whether the reverse-engineered numbers hold up on real parts:

| Item | Derived | Measured | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall envelope | 144 × 141 × 264 mm | *(TBD)* | |
| M2 clearance hole | Ø2.2 mm | *(TBD)* | |
| M2 counterbore | Ø4.4 mm | *(TBD)* | |
| M2 tapping hole | Ø1.6 mm | *(TBD)* | |
| Bearing seat | Ø22 × 16 × 4 mm | *(TBD)* | |

> FDM printing typically comes out 0.1–0.3 mm undersize on holes. Measured values here are
> valuable to anyone building after us.

## Photos

### 2026-09-02 · First printed parts

![First printed parts](build-log/photos/2026-09-02-首批打印件.jpg)

Printed and partly assembled:

- **Head assembly** — multi-colour print (white / black / red), with the camera bezel and
  indicator opening; surface quality is good
- **Neck** — black, already joined to the head
- **Trunk shell** — white
- **Leg structural parts** — black, **with M2 screws already fitted**
- **Feet** — red / yellow, two of them

> 📌 **First real-world confirmation:** the **M2 screws go into the black leg parts.**
> That means the conclusion in [Fastener Reconstruction](docs/fastener-reconstruction.en.md)
> — that the whole robot is an M2 system — holds on physical parts, at least for these
> holes.
>
> Precise measured hole diameters still to come; see the verification table above.
