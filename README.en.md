# Microduck Replica

**English** · [简体中文](README.md)

> A third-party reconstruction study of [Pollen Robotics' Microduck](https://pollen-robotics.com/microduck/).
> Assembly drawings, exploded views, CAD-importable assemblies, and a complete
> electronics teardown — all derived from publicly released files and source code.

Microduck is a 25 cm, 737 g bipedal robot duck driven by 15 Dynamixel XL330 servos
(14 under policy control) that learns to walk with reinforcement learning.

Its **software is open source (Apache-2.0)**. Its hardware is **partly** open:

- ✅ **The RPI Robot HAT board is fully published** — [`pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT)
  (Apache-2.0): KiCad 9 project, Gerbers, BOM, pick-and-place and STEP. **You do not need to redraw this board.**
- ❌ **The `imu_to_dxl` board is not published** — no public project exists anywhere; the reconstruction
  in this repo is the only one available.
- ❌ **No editable mechanical CAD**, no whole-robot BOM, no assembly documentation. Pollen Robotics
  [told the press not to call it "open-source hardware" (for now)](docs/社区动态.md).

> 📌 **Correction (2026-09-03)**: this document previously stated "its hardware is not [open], no PCB
> schematics". **That was wrong** — it searched only `pollen-robotics/microduck` and missed the
> organisation's `elec_`-prefixed hardware repositories.

But two public artifacts turn out to be enough:

1. **`microduck_rl` ships the full MJCF model and 47 STL meshes.** The MJCF contains the
   complete kinematic tree — which part mounts to which, relative positions accurate to
   0.1 mm, joint axes, travel limits, masses and inertia tensors.
2. **The Rust runtime is open source, and a runtime that drives real hardware must
   hard-code device paths, I²C addresses, register offsets, baud rates and protocols.**
   The code *is* the datasheet.

This repository is what falls out of reading both.

> ✅ **Independently verified.** On 2026-08-31, [@tspy](https://x.com/tspy/status/2094249218735300630)
> published a hardware teardown on X (169 likes) that matches this repository's
> conclusions exactly — including the critical one: **the main board is a Radxa Zero 3W**.
> Two independent paths, one answer. See [Community Intelligence](docs/社区动态.md).

## Two tracks — pick one

This repository covers two servo choices. **Mechanics, electronics and software all differ**, so decide before building:

| | Original · Dynamixel XL330 | Feetech · HD-1910 |
|---|---|---|
| **Servos** | XL330-M288-T ×15 | HD-1910-C001 ×15 — half the price, 2.5× the torque |
| **Voltage** | rated 6 V, run at 6.6–8.2 V, **37% over** | rated 4–8.4 V, within spec; a full pack sits at the 8.4 V ceiling |
| **Printed parts** | [CAD repository · XL330](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad) | [CAD repository · Feetech](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad); mating parts are not interchangeable |
| **Editable CAD** | [CAD repo v1.1](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad/releases/tag/v1.1) | [CAD repo v2.1](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad/releases/tag/v2.1), files carry an `-FT` suffix |
| **Electronics** | official HAT + [`imu_to_dxl`](hardware/imu_to_dxl/) | same; servo connectors are 2.0 mm (official 2.5), `imu_to_dxl` has J4/J5 at 2.0 |
| **Software** | official runtime runs as-is | different bus protocol, swap the protocol module — [adaptation architecture](software/飞特适配架构.md) (zh); policy retrained for HD-1910 — [training data checklist](docs/HD-1910训练前数据清单.md) |
| **Status** | paper analysis + first prints | Assembled and stood up (09-18); Armbian + HAT read all 14 joints during a 3,000-round pose-holding window at about 46.87 Hz with no missing responses. Mouth ID 29 excluded at the operator's request and unverified. Camera capture verified only on official B1; Armbian retest pending |

The selection argument is in [Actuator Selection](docs/actuator-selection.en.md). This repo's main line is Feetech; the original track is documented just as fully.

## Latest

**2026-09-29 — Image login correction:** The original public image requires **`root / 1234`** for the first login. Complete the Armbian wizard before using `duck / duck1234`; it also changes the root password. Change both default passwords immediately. The old image still needs the `wlan0` DHCP fix. The [guide](tools/radxa/镜像使用说明.md) is corrected, and a separate [DHCP fix candidate image](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica/releases/tag/radxa-zero3w-armbian-20260929) has passed offline checks; **this new artifact has not been flashed and boot-tested on hardware**. It contains neither the robot runtime nor the web servo console.

**2026-09-28 — HAT feedback test:** Web console **0.15.4** is deployed on the board, with responses matched by their actual servo ID and a 50 Hz sampling target. While holding the existing pose for about 64 seconds, all 14 joints returned **3,000/3,000** valid samples (42,000 total), with no timeout, checksum or ID errors in that window. The observed rate was **46.87 Hz**. Torque remained enabled and goals/settings were unchanged. **The full control loop with IMU, inference and motion writes, and the walking policy, remain unverified.** Occasional missing responses have occurred outside this window. See the [test scope and results](tools/radxa/50Hz保持姿势读状态-20260928.md) (Chinese).

**2026-09-28 — HAT and camera bring-up:** The HAT has arrived and been fitted to the board. After the camera ribbon orientation/contact was corrected, the Radxa Camera 8M219 was identified and **40 frames at 1920×1080** were captured on official Bookworm B1. The next step is to return to the project Armbian image and repeat the test with the corrected wiring. Sustained frame rate, all HAT functions and robot walking remain unverified. See the [wiring reference and test record](tools/radxa/摄像头调试记录-20260928.md) (Chinese).

### 🔌 Electronics · all 15 servos powered up in the assembled duck, and it stands (2026-09-18)

<p align="center"><a href="assets/首次上电-2026-09-18.mp4"><img src="assets/首次上电-站起来.gif" alt="First power-on: standing up from the tucked pose (click for the 30 s video)" width="220"></a></p>

First time the assembled duck was on the bus: URT-2 over USB, 7.4 V into V1, **all 15 HD-1910 online, 0 timeouts, 0 checksum errors**, one sync_read of 15 servos in 4.8 ms.
Driven from the new [web servo console](tools/servo-web/) in this repo: sliders, saved poses, sequences, a 3D model that follows the real robot and a live centre-of-mass marker against the foot support.
Above, it stands up from the tucked pose **by itself**, then sits back down. **First step of the Feetech software path works**; the hardware plan holds.

The above is the 09-18 test. Earlier on 09-28, the failed ID 21 servo was replaced with the former mouth servo (ID 34), with centre calibration confirmed at 2048. The operator later assigned the mouth ID 29, whose firmware/model fields were detected during a scan. This test covers 14 joints; mouth ID 29 is excluded at the operator's request and remains unverified. The old “all 15 online” result is not the current acceptance result. Feetech-protocol [`imu_to_dxl` firmware 0.2.0](hardware/imu_to_dxl/firmware/) is available; physical bus testing is still pending.

**All 15 Feetech HD-1910 servos configured and mounted.** Not the official XL330 — half the

[Actuator Selection](docs/actuator-selection.en.md), now physical.

**The HD-1910 horn protrudes where the XL330's is recessed**, so the 8 parts that mate with

### 💻 Software · web console driving 15 servos over the serial bus

<p align="center"><a href="tools/servo-web/"><img src="assets/servo-web.png" alt="Web console: sliders, 3D duck, CoM projection" width="420"></a></p>

Drag a slider in the browser and the servo moves; the 3D duck follows, and the centre-of-mass
projection shows live whether it still falls inside the foot support polygon. Save poses, run
sequences, calibrate the zero in one click, dump every register, measure bus timing — this is the
tool used for assembly and bench acceptance.

The backend does not use the Feetech SDK: [`feetech.py`](tools/servo-web/feetech.py) speaks the
2026 protocol manual directly in about a hundred lines. It ships with a **packet-level servo
simulator**, so calibration, ID changes and register writes are self-tested with no hardware attached.

`FeetechIo` for the official runtime (the `RobotIo` seam, rustypot protocol v1) is written and
waiting on the zero calibration before it goes on the board.

### 🧠 Algorithms · public 1910 M6 parameter integration

The Feetech simulation baseline adopts the **1910 BAM M6 actuator parameters published by
[LuwuDynamics/xgoduck_rl](https://github.com/LuwuDynamics/xgoduck_rl)**. Thank you to LuwuDynamics
for sharing them. These parameters were not independently identified by this replica project.
The [provenance record](docs/HD-1910-M6参数来源.md) includes the pinned source revision,
original-file checksum and Apache-2.0 license.

The complete training project is included in **[`software/training/`](software/training/)**:
one clone includes the source, actuator parameters and simulation models. See the
[run guide and controller initialization fix](software/training/docs/hd1910-baseline.md).
Training builds on [Pollen Robotics/microduck_rl](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl)
and [Rhoban/BAM](https://github.com/Rhoban/bam). Integration tests and a short training check
have passed; there is no walking policy validated on this replica yet. Hardware testing still
needs joint calibration, IMU/runtime integration, and checks of actual mass/inertia and servo response.

## 🦆 Contributions from the flock

This repo is not one person's work. Merged code and bench-verified findings are credited here.

| Who | What they contributed |
|---|---|
| [@yoyojacky](https://github.com/yoyojacky) | **A Rust test tool for Feetech servos** ([PR #27](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica/pull/27), merged). A minimal STS/SCS protocol implementation of his own (framing, checksum, ping, register read/write, status parsing). The CLI scans the bus with a progress bar, reads status, moves a servo to a position, and runs single or batch tests that report position error, peak current, peak load, voltage and temperature, with a PASS/FAIL verdict — one command gives you a bench acceptance table → [`tools/sts3215Servo_testtool/`](tools/sts3215Servo_testtool/) |
| [@Abo1ish](https://github.com/Abo1ish) | **IMU board firmware + attitude view in the debug console** ([PR #32](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica/pull/32), merged). A base STM32G031 firmware for the imu_to_dxl board that Pollen never open-sourced, verified on real hardware, with host-side tests and a [`VALIDATION.md`](hardware/imu_to_dxl/firmware/VALIDATION.md) that is clear about its limits → [`hardware/imu_to_dxl/firmware/`](hardware/imu_to_dxl/firmware/). He also streams the IMU attitude over J-Link into the web debug console, so the 3D duck's body turns with the real board (`--imu-jlink`, or `--imu-demo` with no hardware) → [`tools/servo-web/`](tools/servo-web/) |
| A member of the WeChat group | **Boot recipe for the Radxa Zero 3W V1.12J.** On this batch (WiFi changed to AIC8800DS2), swapping in Radxa's bootloader is not enough. He found by testing that the device tree has to come from Radxa too: **B1 bootloader + B1 DTB + Armbian 6.1.115 kernel + Trixie userland**, and got it booting → written up in the [pitfalls log](踩坑记录.md#软件) and the [image guide](tools/radxa/镜像使用说明.md) (both Chinese) |

### Projects from the flock

Some people build duck-related things in their own repos. The good ones get a shout-out here:

| Project | Author | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [microduck-color-studio](https://github.com/LathamZ/microduck-color-studio) ([live demo](https://lathamz.github.io/microduck-color-studio/)) | [@LathamZ](https://github.com/LathamZ) | **A 3D color studio for the duck: settle the colors in your browser before you print.** Color each of the 70 parts, pick a material (PLA / matte / PETG / metallic / carbon fiber / TPU) and lighting to preview. Enter the filaments you already own and it recommends palettes from your stock (use what you have / add one color / acrylic accents). You can also import your own 3MF (e.g. the Feetech version) and export a **colored multi-plate 3MF** plus per-part STLs, with presets for Bambu P1S / A1 mini / H2D. Chinese and English UI, works on mobile |
| [MICDUCK_FTHD1901_REBUILD](https://github.com/fengj4780-sudo/MICDUCK_FTHD1901_REBUILD) | [@fengj4780-sudo](https://github.com/fengj4780-sudo) | **Feetech-build structural rework with optional CNC reinforcement.** Builds on our [editable SolidWorks drawings](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad): adapted to the Feetech servo (written as HD1901 in that repo; the part files are HD-1910-C001), weak parts reinforced, assembly interferences fixed and some broken models repaired. **Five leg parts can be made as CNC parts** for better load paths (still being prototyped; the author estimates about ¥45 for all five including shipping); printing them instead also works and is stronger than the original. Includes a one-click 3MF (Bambu H2D, 0.4 mm, 5 plates) and the reworked SolidWorks drawings (Chinese) |

## Exploded Assembly View

![Exploded view](assembly-drawings/06_爆炸图_四分之三.png)

Seven drawings under `assembly-drawings/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `01_正面` `02_侧面` `03_背面` `04_四分之三` | Front / side / rear / isometric, assembled, natural colors |
| **`05_爆炸图_侧面`** | 15 parts exploded along the kinematic chain, labeled with names and masses |
| **`06_爆炸图_四分之三`** | Isometric — shows the left/right leg mirroring clearly |
| `07_分色对照_装配态` | Assembled state in the same color coding, for cross-reference |

## Assembly Structure

```
Trunk 199 g
├─ L hip yaw→roll 23 g → L hip roll 6 g → L thigh 48 g → L shin 22 g → L ankle+foot 30 g
├─ Neck base 37 g → Neck pitch 6 g → Head yaw/roll 49 g → Head assembly + beak 189 g
└─ R hip yaw→roll 23 g → R hip roll 6 g → R thigh 48 g → R shin 22 g → R ankle+foot 30 g

Total 737.2 g   Envelope 144 × 141 × 264 mm
```

The trunk and the head weigh almost the same (199 g vs 189 g) — **the head is a quarter of
the whole robot and the center of mass sits high**, which explains why its walking policy
is hard to train.

## Joint Parameters

Five DoF per leg, four for neck and head — **14 under policy control**.
The robot actually carries **15 Dynamixel XL330**: the 15th drives the beak through a
passive linkage and never enters the action space.

| Joint | Travel |
|---|---|
| `hip_yaw` | −25° … +30° |
| `hip_roll` | ±22° |
| `hip_pitch` / `knee` / `ankle` / `head_pitch` | ±90° |
| `neck_pitch` | −90° … +60° |
| `head_yaw` | ±170° |
| `head_roll` | ±25° |

## 📋 Bill of Materials

**What to buy and how many** — [`BOM.en.md`](BOM.en.md)

15 servos, 14 bearings, ~325 fasteners, 2 boards to fabricate. Quantities are counted from geom
references in the upstream MJCF (38 mesh types / 75 instances), not estimated. Includes a per-board
parts list with LCSC numbers.

> ⚠️ Two corrections in there that stop you buying the wrong thing: **the battery is an NP-F550,
> not an F970**, and **the XL330 is run over-voltage**.

## Print files and CAD assemblies

**Download models from [fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad).** SolidWorks, STEP, print projects, assembly BOMs and installation instructions are maintained together there.

| Servo version | CAD release checked on 2026-09-28 |
|---|---|
| Feetech HD-1910 | [v2.1](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad/releases/tag/v2.1) |
| Dynamixel XL330 | [v1.1](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad/releases/tag/v1.1) |

The old `print/` parts and `cad/` assembly STLs came from upstream simulation geometry and did not include the physical CAD changes. Those files have been removed; the directories now contain download pointers. **Do not mix the two servo versions or print simulation/web-viewer meshes from this repository.**

The CAD repository's older 09-15 3MF does not include the v2.1 combined wheel. Check the attachment version; see [printing notes](print/README.en.md). CAD modelling and assembly documentation are by **机械行者Robo**, with attribution and licensing in the CAD repository.

| **Custom board 2** | **RPI Robot HAT** — TLV320AIC3104 @ 0x18, a dormant BMI088, a Stemma header for the ToF. **Published by Pollen** ([`elec_RPI_Robot_HAT`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT)) |

The `imu_to_dxl` design is the elegant part: the IMU is not on I²C. It presents itself as a
Dynamixel slave, so orientation arrives in the same bus transaction as the joint states —
no second bus, no host-side sensor fusion (the LSM6DSV16X's on-chip SFLP block emits a game
rotation quaternion and estimates its own gyro bias).

## Can You Actually Build One?

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Part geometry | ✅ 47 STLs |
| Assembly relationships | ✅ 0.1 mm accurate, drawings produced |
| Joint axes / travel | ✅ all 14 |
| Mass / inertia | ✅ all 15 bodies |
| Servo model | ✅ Dynamixel XL330 × 15 |
| Bearings | ✅ Ø22×16×4 and Ø15×10×3 |
| Battery / sensors | ✅ NP-F550 2S, IMX219, VL53L8CX, LSM6DSV16X |
| Main board | ✅ **Radxa Zero 3W, off the shelf** |
| **HAT board** | ✅ **Officially published** — KiCad + Gerbers + BOM → [`elec_RPI_Robot_HAT`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT) |
| **`imu_to_dxl` board** | ⚠️ Not published; must be redrawn. Protocol and register layout fully recovered |
| **Fastener list** | ✅ Reverse-engineered from hole features → M2 system |
| **Cable routing** | ❌ Nothing published |
| Control software | ⚠️ Rust runtime is Apache-2.0 and **runs as-is on the same main board** |

⚠️ **Simulation STLs are not manufacturing files.** Simulation only needs outer shape and
inertia — it guarantees nothing about fit tolerances, threads, heat-set insert bosses or
cable clearance. Printing these directly will most likely not assemble.

💰 **Building one probably costs more than buying one — but how much more depends entirely on
your channel.** Fifteen XL330s run about **$359** at ROBOTIS international, **$412** at ROBOTIS US,
and **€603–629** in Europe inc-VAT — anywhere from slightly under the robot's retail price to well
above it. Add the compute module, battery, two boards to fabricate and filament, and it is certainly
more. Full costing: [BOM.en.md](BOM.en.md).

**The conclusion has been revised** from "the mechanics are copyable, the electronics are a wall"
to **"the whole robot is reproducible"** — the main board is an off-the-shelf module, and the custom
boards' function and protocol have been fully recovered from source.
See [Hardware Teardown](docs/hardware-teardown.en.md).

## The Realistic Path

Skip 100% replication and go **"copy the mechanics, build your own electronics"**:

| | Approach |
|---|---|
| Mechanics | Select the matching servo version in the [CAD repository](https://github.com/fanhao375/microduck-replica-cad) |
| Servos | XL330 × 15, off the shelf |
| Main board | **Radxa Zero 3W**, same as the original |
| IMU board | Roll your own `imu_to_dxl`: LSM6DSV16X + a small MCU + half-duplex transceiver. The protocol is fully documented here |
| HAT | **Order the official Gerbers** (4-layer); or skip it entirely if you don't need audio |
| Software | Same main board → the official Rust runtime runs unmodified |
| Policies | The nine shipped ONNX policies work; retrain with [microduck_rl](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl) if you change hardware |

## Three Pitfalls Worth Knowing

1. **Armbian runs a login console on UART2.** `serial-getty@ttyS2` holds the port —
   `systemctl mask` it. Pollen found this with `fuser -v /dev/ttyS2`.
2. **i2c3 collides with the FUSB302.** Using the hardware I²C on header pins 3/5 costs you
   USB-C PD negotiation (plain 5 V charging still works).
3. **The NPU ships disabled** in Armbian — flash the overlay and reboot to run RKNN models.

## Ecosystem Map

Microduck material is scattered across several GitHub orgs and three HuggingFace resource types —
**the official hardware repos are especially easy to miss**. [`docs/ecosystem.en.md`](docs/ecosystem.en.md)
annotates every official repo, simulator, policy, dataset and community project with what it is and
what it is good for.

## Documentation

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [**Hardware Spec Sheet**](docs/硬件规格速查.md) | One-page reference — block diagram, part numbers, bus parameters, build list, pitfalls |
| [**Hardware Primer**](docs/硬件入门.md) | **Board by board** — what each of the five modules does, how one 20 ms control tick flows, what changes on the Feetech route, and a closing section on **five checks to run before you replicate** |
| [**Electronics Sourcing (CN)**](docs/电控采购清单.md) | Taobao links with verified availability — main board, camera, ToF, power, both PCBs, cabling and the debug adapter |
| [**Mechanical Sourcing (CN)**](docs/机械采购清单.md) | Bearings, M2 fasteners, heat-set inserts and the insertion tip, thread locker, filament |
| [**Hardware Teardown**](docs/hardware-teardown.en.md) 🇬🇧 | **Full derivation with evidence citations — the main board, both custom boards, bus protocol, sensors, power** |
| [**Actuator Selection**](docs/actuator-selection.en.md) 🇬🇧 | XL330 parameters, BAM M6 config, five calibrated PD sets, backlash modeling — plus **why closed-loop steppers do not work here, what swapping to a Feetech STS3215 actually costs** (737 g vs 2107 g, measured), and a **cross-comparison of same-class servos** including a deep assessment of the Unitree S288 |
| [**Fastener Reconstruction**](docs/fastener-reconstruction.en.md) 🇬🇧 | Hole-feature scan across 47 STLs → M2 system and purchase quantities |
| [Community Intelligence](docs/社区动态.md) | X / GitHub signals, independent verification, noise and scam warnings |
| [Progress](PROGRESS.md) | Status, decisions, open work |

> 🇬🇧 marks documents available in English. The rest are Chinese-only for now — their
> tables, part numbers, addresses and diagrams are readable without it, and machine
> translation handles the prose well.

## Reproducing This

```bash
# 1. Fetch upstream for the drawing scripts below (training is already in software/training/)
bash scripts/fetch_upstream.sh

# 2. Regenerate the drawings
python scripts/render_assembly.py upstream/microduck_rl assembly-drawings

# 3. Export upstream assembly previews for analysis (not manufacturing)
python scripts/export_assembly_stl.py upstream/microduck_rl analysis-output/cad-upstream

# 4. Re-scan hole features
python scripts/analyze_holes.py upstream/microduck_rl/src/mjlab_microduck/robot/microduck/assets
```

Requires `mujoco`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `scipy`. Rendering needs a working OpenGL context.
