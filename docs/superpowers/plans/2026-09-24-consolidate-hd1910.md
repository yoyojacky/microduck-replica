# Consolidate HD1910 training in microduck-replica

The user requested that the just-published training work live in microduck-replica,
and delegated the repository arrangement. This supersedes the earlier decision
to keep training only in a separate fork.

**Goal:** Clone or download one repository and get the complete HD1910 training
source, geometry, parameters, initialization fix, dependencies, tests and docs.

**Design:** Import the tracked training tree from fanhao375/microduck_rl revision
`d9e1926c5220a0eb79fa5aab9df7b336f8e9a226` as a fixed-revision source snapshot at
`software/training/`. Ordinary clones include the contents; no submodule or
cross-repository setup is required. Preserve licenses, parameter bytes and
upstream attribution. Keep logs, caches, videos and virtual environments excluded.
The existing fork remains an historical source, not a second active entry point.

**Scope:** This migration covers the HD1910 training work from this conversation.
It does not move the unrelated Rust runtime or CAD repositories. Preserve the
pre-existing uncommitted training-data checklist in the user's main checkout.

## Steps

- [x] Import the fixed training revision using `git archive` into `software/training/`.
  The source checkout is shallow; use a source snapshot without importing its Git history.
- [x] Make the training README's first runnable instructions target this repository
  and HD1910. Preserve the original README as `README.upstream.md`.
- [x] Update root Chinese/English README, software README, parameter provenance,
  training guide, NOTICE and LICENSE routing to the in-repository training path.
- [x] Verify parameter checksum and source-file identity for physics and tests.
  Install the moved project into an isolated WSL environment using the lockfile;
  run the 26 relevant tests and the 64-env/5-iteration smoke test from its new path.
- [x] Independently review migration links, licenses and path behavior. If a real
  issue is reported, have a second agent verify that issue before changing code.
- [x] Fast-forward local master without changing the user's uncommitted checklist,
  push master and verify that remote code and parameters match.

## Validation boundary

The unchanged simulation baseline was previously verified; migration checks must
prove it works from software/training with the correct import path. A smoke
checkpoint is not a trained or hardware-validated gait. No hardware access occurs.

## Verification results

- Fresh locked WSL install in a separate environment; 26 relevant tests passed.
- 64 environments, 5 PPO iterations, 7,680 transitions; all five NaN termination
  metrics were zero. The short run is a pipeline check, not a walking policy.
- Independent review identified a monorepo HF Jobs archive-root bug and an
  inherited geometry-license wording conflict. A second reviewer confirmed both.
  Fixed the archive project-root lookup and license wording; 4 offline packaging
  regression cases passed. Final independent review found no further actionable issues.
- 233 original source files imported. Only the primary README, HD1910 guide,
  parameter provenance README and HF Jobs packaging module differ; the original
  README is retained as README.upstream.md. Training/actuator logic, locked
  dependencies, geometry, parameters and existing tests retain source content.
- Parameter SHA-256 remains
  `ef2d51adfb1cc0831b9b02ca19aa9176fceecdf725148d084378d7d9a64afceb`.
- Import commit `25791f0bd260fd869ed841578785fa8d7e14396d` was pushed to
  `fanhao375/microduck-replica` master; the remote training tree and parameter
  blob `5a1af6ce935fdf58e0ad021f5297c933397d67e8` were verified through GitHub.
  The user's pre-existing uncommitted checklist retained its original SHA-256.
- Whitespace checks pass for authored changes. The imported snapshot retains
  upstream whitespace and file modes so unchanged files preserve their Git blobs.
