# Microduck Ecosystem Map

[简体中文](生态导航.md) · **English**

Microduck material is scattered across several GitHub organisations and three HuggingFace resource
types. **The official hardware repositories are especially easy to miss** — they are not in the main
repo and carry an `elec_` prefix.

This index says what each thing **is** and **what it is good for**. Figures are as of **2026-09-04**;
star counts move.

## 1. Official repositories (pollen-robotics)

### The two core ones

| Repository | ★ | Licence | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**microduck**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck) | 6982 | Apache-2.0 | **The on-board runtime.** Everything that runs on the robot, in Rust: the 50 Hz control loop, updater, BLE, camera/WebRTC, ToF, voice. It is also where the hardware spec lives — device paths, I²C addresses and registers are all hard-coded in the source |
| [**microduck_rl**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl) | 1668 | Apache-2.0 | **The RL training environment** (built on mjlab). **The 47 STLs and the full MJCF are here** — the only source of geometry |

### Hardware (the two people miss)

| Repository | ★ | Licence | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**elec_RPI_Robot_HAT**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT) | 15 | Apache-2.0 | ⭐ **The HAT board, fully published.** KiCad 9 schematic and PCB, Gerbers, BOM, pick-and-place, STEP, and every datasheet. **You do not draw this board — download `production/` and have it made** (4-layer) |
| [**lib_KiCAD**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/lib_KiCAD) | 3 | — | Pollen's KiCad symbol / footprint / 3D-model library. **Required to open the project above**, otherwise it is a field of unresolved symbols |

> Many people believe "Microduck hardware isn't open" — **the HAT board is open**, it just isn't in
> the main repo. What genuinely is not published: the `imu_to_dxl` board, editable mechanical CAD,
> and a whole-robot BOM.

### Supporting

| Repository | ★ | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [rustypot](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/rustypot) | 56 | Dynamixel communication library (Rust). The runtime talks to servos through it; `xl330.rs` carries the full register map |
| [microduck-gst-plugins](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck-gst-plugins) | 13 | Prebuilt aarch64 GStreamer plugins: Rockchip MPP hardware encoders + WebRTC |
| `duck_detector` | — | ⚠️ **Not public** (404). The training repo for the NPU detection model. Upstream docs cite it, but outsiders cannot reach it |

## 2. HuggingFace

### Simulators and visualisation

| Name | ♥ | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [**pollen-robotics/microduck-simulator**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/microduck-simulator) | **374** | ⭐ **The official web simulator — open it and play**, nothing to install. Start here |
| [mishig/microduck-anatomy](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/microduck-anatomy) | 6 | Anatomy visualisation, by an HF employee |
| multimodalart/microduck-ar | 1 | AR viewer |
| AlexWortega/microduck-vla-simulator | 0 | Vision-language-action simulation |

### Policies

| Name | ♥ | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [**pollen-robotics/microduck-policies**](https://huggingface.co/pollen-robotics/microduck-policies) | 8 | ⭐ **The official nine ONNX policies.** Same hardware means you can use them as-is, no retraining |
| [RemiFabre/microduck-flamingo-cycle](https://huggingface.co/RemiFabre/microduck-flamingo-cycle) | 21 | Posted by Rémi himself — one-legged standing cycle |
| RemiFabre/microduck-rough-walk-e / -g | 1 | Rough-terrain walking |

The community has a growing set of motion policies: `happy-hop`, `polite-bow`, `moonwalk-backward`,
`beak-throw`, `electric-slide`, `swing`, `stilts`, `running`.

> Upstream ships `uv run publish` — one command to push a policy you trained to the Hub.

### Datasets (only just appearing)

| Name | Updated | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [craigm26/microduck-stairs-challenge](https://huggingface.co/datasets/craigm26/microduck-stairs-challenge) | 09-02 | Stair climbing |
| craigm26/microduck-ball-challenge | 09-02 | Ball chasing |
| allen73/microduck-trajectory-dataset | 09-02 | Trajectories |
| devorah-ai-2026/microduck-locomotion-dataset-v1 | 09-03 | Locomotion |
| pngwn/microduck-detection-dataset | 09-03 | Object detection |
| craigm26/microduck-policy-golden-vectors | 08-31 | Golden vectors for policy regression tests |

> Datasets clustered in early September — the community moving **from playing to training**.

### Historical trail

| Repository | Note |
|---|---|
| [TommyZihao/microduck_runtime](https://github.com/TommyZihao/microduck_runtime) | **A public mirror of the prototype runtime.** The original `apirrone/microduck_runtime` has gone private. It records one thing worth knowing: **the prototype used a BNO055 over I²C**, not today's `imu_to_dxl` board |
